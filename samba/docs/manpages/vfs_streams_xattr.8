vfs_streams_xattr - Store alternate data streams in posix xattrs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
vfs objects = streams_xattr
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
The
vfs_streams_xattr
enables storing of NTFS alternate data streams in the file system\. As a normal posix file system does not support the concept of multiple data streams per file, the streams_xattr module stores the data in posix extended attributes (xattrs)\. The name of these attributes is user\.DosStream\."ADS\-NAME"\.
.PP
The file system that is shared with this module enabled must support xattrs\.
.PP
Please note that most file systems have severe limitations on the size of xattrs\. So this module might work for applications like IE that stores small zone information in streams but will fail for applications that store serious amounts of data in ADSs\.

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\.
